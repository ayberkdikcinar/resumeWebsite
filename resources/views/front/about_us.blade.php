             <h2>When, Who and Where?</h2>
             <p>Chamb was born in 2014 and has steadily grown from the seed of an idea into a fully-fledged company that, with the power of the internet, employs people from every corner of the planet.</p>
             <p>Chamb hails from the Bosporus strait straddling Istanbul. Taking cues from this continent and culture spanning city, we bring people and place together in new and unexpected ways. Chamb may have its roots firmly planted in Turkey, but gaze out across fertile lands of Europe and you’ll see its branches spreading a canopy of connection and possibility across the globe.</p>

             <p>Chamb is the brainchild of Bayram Filikci. Danish born with Turkish descent, like the famously business savvy Ottomans of old, Bayram has a flair for creativity and business growth hacking. And along with Chamb’s team, we all count ourselves as passionate entrepreneurs who live for the sole purpose of finding solutions to your problems.</p>
             <p>After gaining much experience in building business from scratch and nurturing them to fruition, the team set its sights on creating a gateway that could help fledgling companies establish new relationships that will propel them forward to unrivalled riches.</p>
